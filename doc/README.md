# What is Herd?

Herd is a client-side library responsible for reading a Chronicle (or any number
of replication instances of the Chronicle, chosen at random) and maintaining an
always-up-to-date representation of the Chronicle's contents, specifically tailored
for a trustless Public Key Infrastructure for software update signing.
